Check this out for a week long rubberducking (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8YELRmUb5o)
Rubber ducking rules:
a. No redundancies: Each line rubber ducked in this file must not repeat in whole or in part what has been runer ducked prior.
b. Study 30 mins of video a day. This will take you no more than 11 days, so Apr 29 - May 9.
